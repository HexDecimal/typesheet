# typesheet

typesheet is a tiny Python script for creating transparent PNG spritesheets from TrueType (.ttf) fonts.

I made it because I couldn't find an easy option online while developing a game.

I welcome contributions, but I don't plan to spend more than a few minutes a month maintaining this repo.

## How to use

`pip install pillow tcod numpy PIL`

There might be more dependencies missing. If so, you should install them the same way.  I'll accept PRs to update the list of deps, but I rarely write Python and can't be bothered to set up a clean-room environment to figure them out myself.

### Also

This code is released under whatever licenses are appropriate given the dependencies.
I claim no ownership etc. and you can use it for whatever you want. I don't care.
